# Tic Tac Toe

## Abstract
I hope you know the popular game Tic Tac Toe. If you don't, It is required for you to go and google it. This project is about making this game drawing directly on the Canvas, there are some elements I had to add from external media (sounds, pictures and animation). For the brain of the game, I developed a JavaScript Decision Tree.

## Introduction
A free choice of a Project for one of the various endings of my Instruction in Basic Coding let me to this idea: Containing a Decision Tree, a conception of Design and many uses of Functions and Logic Cycles used to draw on the Canvas. I consider this as a convenient project.

## The Game
I think the fair election of the first player is an important issue, the one who is going to play first on the board is an important element which deserves plenty of attention. The solution I purpose is throwing dices, and the winner is the first player.

The first player will use the Cross and the second will use the Circle.

## Methods

There are two main Methods present on this code. You can study the other present at the code if you want.

### - Throwing the Dice
There are two dices and everyone has to have a different random number. The closest determined concept to random number it came to my mind was the Random predefined function on JavaScript.

### - The Machine Decision Maker
The way I thought for the machine was to play as a defensive way, If it has to start first it will choose a "random" position. If the game has come to a dead-end, the machine will choose a "random" position.
If you are a good player the expected result is a draw.
